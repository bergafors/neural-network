# neural-network

An implementation of a feedforward neural network. [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) is used for linear algrebra calculations. Tests are implemented using [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).

The example in /examples trains a neural network to recognize images of handwritten digits, and reaches an accuracy of around 93%. The training data is from the MNIST data base of handwritten digits, which can be found [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
